# FeedlySync
Feedly Synchronizer is a Thunderbird Add-On that allows you to keep your RSS lists synchronized with your Feedly account

Log in and add a new entry using Feedly Mobile App or change a category name while using your favourite browser, and they all will be mirrored in Thundebird in a short while.

Make some changes in Thundebird, and they all will be automatically replicated in your Feedly Account

Choose what kind of synchronization you like. You may like to download from server to Thunderbird, and just leave your account without any changes.

You can also upload from Thundebird to the server, and keep your email client changeless. Select full synchronization to go both ways.
