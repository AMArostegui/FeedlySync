# FeedlySync
Feedly Synchronizer is a Thunderbird Add-On that allows you to keep your RSS lists synchronized with your Feedly account

Log in and add a new entry using Feedly Mobile App or change a category name while using your favourite browser, and they all will be mirrored in Thundebird in a short while.

Make some changes in Thundebird, and they all will be automatically replicated in your Feedly Account

Choose what kind of synchronization you like. You may like to download from server to Thunderbird, and just leave your account without any changes.

You can also upload from Thundebird to the server, and keep your email client changeless. Select full synchronization to go both ways.

## Note: This project is now obsolete

During the last years, Thunderbird has been moving in order to clean its API, improve safety and match Firefox changes.

This has meant a huge break with the previous AddOn development framework. First small changes were made and developing a new version to keep up to date was not very time consuming. This happened with breaking changes in Thunderbird 60 and 68.

But recently, from v69 on, the pace of breaking changes has increased and to stay updated has become too much for a project that I run on my spare time.

Sadly, I can no longer continue developing FeedlySynchonizer.
